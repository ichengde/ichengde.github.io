<h2 id="摘要"><a href="#摘要" class="headerlink" title="摘要"></a>摘要</h2><p>Automating the process of neurite tracing from light microscopy stacks of images is essential for large-scale or high-throughput quantitative studies of neural circuits. While the general layout of labeled neurites can be captured by many automated tracing algorithms, it is often not possible to differentiate reliably between the processes belonging to different cells. The reason is that some neurites in the stack may appear broken due to imperfect labeling, while others may appear fused due to the limited resolution of optical microscopy. Trained neuroanatomists routinely resolve such topological ambiguities during manual tracing tasks by combining information about distances between branches, branch orientations, intensities, calibers, tortuosities, colors, as well as the presence of spines or boutons. Likewise, to evaluate different topological scenarios automatically, we developed a machine learning approach that combines many of the above mentioned features. A specifically designed confidence measure was used to actively train the algorithm during user-assisted tracing procedure. Active learning significantly reduces the training time and makes it possible to obtain less than 1% generalization error rates by providing few training examples. To evaluate the overall performance of the algorithm a number of image stacks were reconstructed automatically, as well as manually by several trained users, making it possible to compare the automated traces to the baseline inter-user variability. Several geometrical and topological features of the traces were selected for the comparisons. These features include the total trace length, the total numbers of branch and terminal points, the affinity of corresponding traces, and the distances between corresponding branch and terminal points. Our results show that when the density of labeled neurites is sufficiently low, automated traces are not significantly different from manual reconstructions obtained by trained users.</p>

<h2 id="介绍"><a href="#介绍" class="headerlink" title="介绍"></a>介绍</h2><p>Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. With current technology it is possible to sparsely label specific populations of neurons in vivo and image their processes with high-throughput optical microscopy (see e.g., Stettler et al., 2002; Trachtenberg et al., 2002; De Paola et al., 2006; Wickersham et al., 2007; Lichtman et al., 2008; Wilt et al., 2009; Ragan et al., 2012). Imaging can be done in vivo for circuit development or plasticity studies (Trachtenberg et al., 2002), or ex vivo for circuit mapping projects (Lu et al., 2009). In the latter case, an unprecedented resolution can be achieved by first clarifying the tissue (Hama et al., 2011; Chung et al., 2013), and then imaging the entire brain from thousands of optical sections (Ragan et al., 2012). The overwhelming obstacle remaining on the way to brain mapping is accurate, high-throughput tracing of neurons (Sporns et al., 2005; Lichtman et al., 2008; Miller, 2010; Gillette et al., 2011b; Kozloski, 2011; Lichtman and Denk, 2011; Liu, 2011; Svoboda, 2011; Helmstaedter and Mitra, 2012; Van Essen and Ugurbil, 2012; Perkel, 2013). Presently, accurate traces of complex neuron morphologies can only be obtained manually, which is extremely time consuming (Stepanyants et al., 2004, 2008; Shepherd et al., 2005), and thus impractical for large reconstruction projects.</p>
<p>在底层神经网络中对于突触连通的细节知识的缺失阻碍了我们对脑功能的理解.<br>用现代技术是可能去少量标记特定的神经群,在vivo和通过高通量光学显微镜得到的图像.<br>成像可以在vivo完成,为了神经线路的发展或者粘性研究,或者前vivo对于神经线路测绘工程.在后来发展中,一种崭新的解决方案可以实现对组织的第一清晰度和形成整个大脑的图像变成数以前千计的光学切片.巨大的阻碍留在了如何完成大脑映射:精确高通量的神经元追踪.<br>目前,复杂神经元形态的精确追踪只能手工获得,这是极端耗时的,因此,对于大型重建工程是不切实际的.</p>
<p>Many automated tracing algorithms have been developed in recent years [see e.g., Al-Kofahi et al., 2002; Schmitt et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2007; Al-Kofahi et al., 2008; Losavio et al., 2008; Peng et al., 2010; Srinivasan et al., 2010; Bas and Erdogmus, 2011; Peng et al., 2011; Turetken et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011; Xie et al., 2011; Bas et al., 2012; Choromanska et al., 2012; Turetken et al., 2012 and Meijering, 2010; Donohue and Ascoli, 2011; Parekh and Ascoli, 2013 for review]. In general, existing algorithms can accurately capture the geometrical layout of neurites but are not guaranteed to recover their correct branching topology (Figure 1). Topological errors are inevitably present in traces obtained from low signal-to-noise images, images of non-uniformly labeled neurites, or images with high density of labeled structures. Close examination of such traces often reveals topological errors such as broken branches, missing branches, and incorrectly resolved branch crossover regions (stolen branches). This is a particular concern for high-throughput projects where topological errors can accumulate over multiple stacks. For example, while tracing a long-range axon from one optical section to the next, even a very low error-rate, say 5% per section, will almost certainly lead to erroneous connectivity after about 20 sections (typically about 10 mm), rendering the trace unusable for brain mapping projects. Clearly, the rate of topological errors in automated reconstruction projects must be carefully controlled (Chothani et al., 2011).</p>
<p>在近年来许多自动追踪算法已经发展,在一般情况下,现存的算法可以精确捕获到神经元的几何布局,但是不保证恢复正确分支节点的技术.<br>从低信噪比图像和非均匀地标记的神经突的图像中,对于现存的追踪获取,技术错误是不可避免的.<br>这样的追踪方法在仔细检查下,常常会发现技术错误,例如破碎的分支,缺失的分支,和错误解决的分支交叉区域.这是备受关注的高通量项目,拓扑学错误可以累积多个堆栈中,例如,当追踪长轴突从一个光学切片到下一个,即使是一个非常低的错误率,如每切片5%,几乎毫无疑问地导致错误的连通性,在大约20个切片后(通常是十毫米),致使这个追踪是不能用的对于大脑映射工程.明显的,技术错误的几率在自动化重建工程必须是小心地被控制的.</p>
<p>In this study we describe an active machine learning approach (Settles, 2012) that has the potential to significantly reduce the number of topological errors in automated traces. Our algorithm first detects a geometrically accurate trace with the Fast Marching method (Cohen et al., 1994; Cohen and Kimmel, 1997; Sethian, 1999; Mukherjee and Stepanyants, 2012), which was extended to incorporate multiple seed points. Next, the initial trace is dismantled to the level of individual branches, and active learning is applied to reconnect this trace based on knowledge of neuron morphology. We show that active learning does not require large sets of training examples, and the results generalize well on image stacks acquired under similar experimental conditions. What is more, when the density of labeled neurites is sufficiently low, automated traces are not significantly different from reconstructions produced manually by trained users.</p>
<h2 id="方法"><a href="#方法" class="headerlink" title="方法"></a>方法</h2><p>Results of this study are based on the analyses of two datasets featured at the DIADEM challenge (Brown et al., 2011). The OP dataset includes 9 image stacks containing axons of single olfactory projection neurons from Drosophila (Jefferis et al., 2007), and the L6 dataset consists of 6 image stacks containing axons of multiple layer 6 neurons imaged in layer 1 of mouse visual cortex (De Paola et al., 2006). The NCTracer software (www.neurogeometry.net) was used to trace each image stack automatically, as well as manually. The manual traces were generated independently for each stack by three trained users.</p>
<p>这项研究的结果是基于两个有特点的数据集在”王冠”的挑战.这OP数据集包括了9个图像堆,包含了果蝇属的单嗅觉工程神经集的轴突,和由6图像堆组成的L6数据集,包含了多层次的6个神经在小鼠视觉皮层的1层成像的轴突.NCTracer软件(www.neurogeometry.net)是被用于自动化追踪每一个图像堆,同时也可以手工.对于每一个图像堆,通过三个训练有素的用户,这手工追踪可以被独立生成.</p>
<h3 id="神经元的初始化追踪"><a href="#神经元的初始化追踪" class="headerlink" title="神经元的初始化追踪"></a>神经元的初始化追踪</h3><p>The Initial Trace of Neurites<br>We refer to any trace providing geometrically accurate information about the layout of neurites within an image stack as an initial trace. Numerous segmentation and tracking-based methods (see e.g., Al-Kofahi et al., 2002; Schmitt et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2007; Al-Kofahi et al., 2008; Losavio et al., 2008; Peng et al., 2010; Srinivasan et al., 2010; Bas and Erdogmus, 2011; Peng et al., 2011; Turetken et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011; Xie et al., 2011; Bas et al., 2012; Choromanska et al., 2012; Turetken et al., 2012) can be used to produce initial traces. In this study we adapt the Fast Marching method (Cohen et al., 1994; Cohen and Kimmel, 1997; Sethian, 1999; Mukherjee and Stepanyants, 2012) to grow the initial trace from multiple seed points (Figure 2), analogous to the way light from multiple point sources spreads through a non-uniform medium. This process is described by the Eikonal boundary value problem (Sethian, 1999):</p>
<p>我们查阅了任何一种追踪都带着在几何学上精确的信息,如神经元的布局,使用一个图像堆作为初始追踪.<br>许多分隔和基于追踪的方法可以用来产生初始追踪,在这项研究中,我们选用了快速行进的方法 (Cohen et al., 1994; Cohen and Kimmel, 1997; Sethian, 1999; Mukherjee and Stepanyants, 2012)从多个种子点去扩张初始追踪,类似于光线从多个点源通过非均匀媒介中传播.这个进程被描述为 光程函数边值问题(Sethian, 1999).</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/UoHM0ui.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In this expression, vector r represents a position in the image stack (or non-uniform medium), I is the image intensity normalized to the 0–1 range (analog of the speed of light in the medium), and ∇ denotes the gradient operator. Light rays originate from the boundary, ∂S, at time zero, and the time map, T(r), provides information about the shortest time of arrival of these rays to various locations in the image. Because higher image intensities correspond to faster speeds of light propagation, the arrival time front in the image will preferentially spread along the high intensity structures of neurites (see Figure 2C).</p>
<p>在这个表达式中,矢量r代表在图像堆中或是在非均匀媒介中的位置,I是图像亮度 归于0-1范围内(类似于光在介质中的速度),∇代表梯度操作子.<br>光射线起源于边界,∂S在零时间，和时间对应,T(r)提供了在极短时间内这些光线到达图像中的不同位置的信息.因为更高的图像亮度代表着光传播的更快的速度.在到达时间前,图像将会优先传播沿着高亮度结构的轴突.</p>
<p>The Fast Marching algorithm of Sethian (Sethian, 1999) is an efficient numerical scheme for solving the Eikonal boundary value problem, Equation (1). Since the speed function in our problem is defined by the image intensity, it is always positive. For positive speed functions it is known that the Eikonal boundary value problem can be solved more efficiently than the commonly used alternative—the Hamilton-Jacobi problem of the Level Set method (Sethian, 1999). One reason is that the stability condition required for a numerical solution of the time-dependent Level Set equation is more stringent than that used to solve the Eikonal problem. Specifically, this condition requires very small time steps and thus the Level Set method is expected to be more time consuming. The second advantage of Fast Marching has to do with the outward only propagation of the fronts, which can be used to find new front points very efficiently (Sethian, 1999).</p>
<p>Sethian 的快速行进算法是一个高效数值方案对于求光程函数边界数值问题(方程1),在我们的问题中,速度被定义成图像的亮度,它始终为正,对于正速度函数,众所周知，在光程函数边值问题上,可以比常用的替代方法[the Hamilton-Jacobi problem of the Level Set method (Sethian, 1999)]更有效地解决。原因之一是，对于随时间变化的水平集方程的数值解所需的稳定性条件是更苛刻的,比用于解决光程函数边界数值问题。特别得，这种情况需要非常小的时间间隔，因而水平集方法预计将耗费更多的时间。快速行进的第二个优点是只在前沿,向外传播，它可用于非常有效地找到新的前进点 (Sethian, 1999).</p>
<p>We implement the Fast Marching algorithm (Sethian, 1999) on a discrete lattice defined by the centers of image voxels, l = (i, j, k)T. Here the time map is evolved from the boundary at T = 0 by taking the upwind solution of a discretized version of Equation (1):</p>
<p>我们实现快速行进算法在离散点阵形式通过图像像素的中心定义, l = (i, j, k)T.这里的时间映射是从在T = 0的边界演变,采用方程的离散版本的upwind解决方案.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/bwuC0nU.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Parameters (sx, sy, sz) in this expression denote the voxel dimensions which may not be the same due to a typically lower z-resolution in confocal and two-photon microscopy images.</p>
<p>参数(i,j,k)在这个表达式代表三维尺寸,并不相同由于一般低z分辨率在共焦和双光子显微镜图像.</p>
<p>The arrival time front is initialized with T = 0 at multiple seed points, which are automatically generated along the structure of neurites based on image intensity (Figure 2A). As was previously described (Mukherjee and Stepanyants, 2012), the arrival time front is allowed to travel a specified distance, Dmax, to establish a local time map. The value of Dmax has to be chosen based on two considerations: Dmax has to be larger than the caliber of neurites (3–5sx for OP and L6) not to produce short spurious branches and, at the same time, not much larger than the shortest branch that needs to be resolved by the algorithm (10sx in this study). Dmax = 15sx was used throughout this study. The path connecting the farthest point of the front to the T = 0 boundary is then found by performing gradient descent on T(i, j, k) (see Figures 2C–E). Next, the gradient descent path is added to the boundary ∂S and the Fast Marching algorithm is re-initialized from the new boundary. This process continues until a stopping condition is reached, at which point the final ∂S defines the initial trace. The stopping condition used in this study is based on the average intensity of the last added branch. When this intensity falls below a set threshold (typically 20% of the average intensity of the existing trace), Fast Marching is paused and can then be continued or terminated by the user.</p>
<p>在达到时间前是用T = 0在多个种子点进行初始化,是用于自动生成沿着神经元结构基于图像亮度.如先前所描述(Mukherjee and Stepanyants, 2012),在到达时间前,是被允许行进规定距离,Dmax 是建立了当地时间映射,Dmax的值基于两个方面考虑:Dmax必须比轴突的口径更大,(3–5sx for OP and L6)不产生短伪分支,与此同时,不比需要由算法来解决的最短分支大得多（10SX在这项研究中）.在整个本研究中使用DMAX = 15sx。该路径连接最接近到T = 0的边界前的最远点的路径,然后由于T（I，J，K）（参见图2C-E）进行梯度下降找到.<br>接下来,梯度下降通道被添加到边界∂S,快速行进算法从新的边界被重新初始化.<br>此过程继续进行,直到达到终止条件.在该点,最终∂S表示初始轨迹.在此研究中使用的停止条件是基于最后添加分支的平均强度.当该亮度降到低于设定的阈值(通常是已经存在的追踪的平均亮度的20%),快速行进被暂停,然后可以由用户继续或终止.</p>

<p>As long as the seed points used to initialize Fast Marching are located in the foreground and are connected by higher than background intensity paths, their Fast Marching fronts are guaranteed to collide. The gradient descent algorithm is invoked in this case as well. Here, gradient descent paths originating from the collision voxel back-propagate into every colliding region, thus connecting their T = 0 boundaries. If there is a break in intensity along a neurite linking two seed points, the Fast Marching algorithm may terminate before the fronts have a chance to collide. In addition, high levels of background intensity may lead to erroneous front collisions. These and other topological errors in the initial trace will be corrected as described in the following sections.</p>
<p>只要位于前景种子点通常用快速行进的初始化  而且是 通过比背景亮度更强的路径来连接, 快速行进的前端一定会碰撞. 在这个场景下,梯度下降算法效果很好,梯度下降路径起点从碰撞的三维像素反向传播到每一个碰撞的区域,因此连接到T=0的边界中.如果在亮度上有断开在神经元的两个种子点之间,快速行进算法也许会停滞在可能碰撞的前端.此外,高亮度的背景会导致接触前端的错误.在接下来所描述的部分,这和其他算法的错误在初始化追踪中将被纠正,</p>
<h2 id="Optimization-of-the-Initial-Trace"><a href="#Optimization-of-the-Initial-Trace" class="headerlink" title="Optimization of the Initial Trace"></a>Optimization of the Initial Trace</h2><h2 id="优化初始追踪"><a href="#优化初始追踪" class="headerlink" title="优化初始追踪"></a>优化初始追踪</h2><p>We represent the initial trace as a graph structure consisting of nodes linked by straight line segments. Each node, k, is described by its position in the stack, rk = (xk, yk, zk)T, and the caliber, Rk, of the neurite at that location. Information about connectivity among the nodes is stored in the adjacency matrix, A. We find this representation to be more convenient than the traditional SWC format of neuron morphology (Cannon et al., 1998) because the latter cannot be used to describe structures containing loops.</p>

<p>Because the initial trace lies sufficiently close to the centerline of neurites, this trace can be optimized by monitoring its fitness in response to small changes in the position and caliber of every node. The fitness function used in this study, yes, consists of the intensity integrated along the trace and regularizing constraints on the positions and calibers of the connected nodes:</p>
<p>因为初始追踪位置十分接近神经的中间线,追踪可以通过监测它适应的每一个节点的位置和口径的微小变化去优化.在这项研究中,使用的适应调整功能，是由轨迹的整体亮度和连接节点的口径与位置的规则约束所组成的</p>
<p>Vectors rk in this expression specify the positions of the trace vertices, while vectors lm denote the positions of voxel centers in the image stack. Index k’ enumerates the neighbors of vertex k. Parameter λ denotes the average density of nodes in the trace, i.e. the number of nodes per voxel. Lagrange multipliers αr &gt; 0 and αR &gt; 0 control the stiffness of the regularizing constraints. The first term in this expression is the convolution of the image with the Laplacian of Gaussian. This convolution can be performed by using the Fast Fourier Transform (Press, 2007) or, in case of relatively small density of trace nodes, it may be faster to perform explicit summation over the index m. In this case, due to the fast decay of the Gaussian factor, the summation can be restricted to a small number of voxels in the vicinity of the trace (see Chothani et al., 2011 for details).</p>

<p>Variable n in this expression enumerates the iteration steps of the algorithm, parameter β &gt; 0 controls the step size, Ĥ denotes the Hessian operator acting on all the node variables {rk(n), Rk(n)}, and -1 in the exponent denotes matrix inversion. The positions and calibers of all nodes of the trace, including branch and terminal points, are synchronously updated at every iteration step. The values of all three terms in the fitness function are monitored during optimization. Optimization is terminated once the relative changes in all three quantities fall below 10−8. For the OP and L6 datasets considered in this study, the optimization procedure typically converges to the optimum solution in less than 50 steps. Optimization improves the layout of branches as well as the placement of branch and terminal points in the initial trace (Vasilkoski and Stepanyants, 2009; Chothani et al., 2011). The values of parameters αr, αR, and β are constrained by the considerations of algorithm stability, speed of convergence, and accurate representation of neurites’ curvature and caliber. Some of these issues were discussed in Vasilkoski and Stepanyants (2009) and Chothani et al. (2011).</p>

To address this problem, we disconnect branches of the initial trace from one another and then assemble them into tree-like structures based on prior knowledge of neuron morphology. In order to discriminate between correct and erroneous ways to assemble branches, different branch merging scenarios are evaluated in a machine learning approach by combining information about various features of the trace. Such features may include distances between branches, branch orientations, average intensities, intensity variations, branch thicknesses, curvatures, tortuosities, colors, and presence of spines or boutons. Features 1–9 of Figure 3 were used to produce the results of this study. These features were selected based on our knowledge of neuroanatomy and intuition gained from manual neuron tracing. We carefully examined the decisions we make when faced with branch merging tasks and initially created a list of 17 features that are shown in Figure 3. Features 15 and 16 are not applicable for the OP and L6 datasets as these datasets include grayscale images of axons only. Features 10–14 and 17 were tested but did not improve the performance of the classifiers. This is why the above features (10–17) were left out of the analysis. This is not to say that features 10–17 are not important; they may be useful for other dataset types.</p>
<p>如图一,即使初始追踪点准确描述神经元几何形状,但它往往不能捕捉到正确的分支的拓扑.为了解决这个问题,我们从中分离各个初始节点的分支和根据神经元形态学的先前知识组合它们成树状结构.为了辩别真假分支节点的通路,不同的分支节点合并脚本在机器学习中优化,通过组合追踪的多样特点信息,这些特点包括分支距离,分支方向,平均亮度,亮度变动,分支厚度,导致弯曲的因素,弯曲,颜色,神经轴突的存在.特征图3的1-9生成本研究的结果.根据我们人工跟踪神经元得到的解剖学与直觉的知识来选择这些特性。我们仔细审核我们所做的决定–对于分支合并任务和初始创建特征图3的17的列表,如图3所示功能15和16不适用于OP和L6数据集,这些数据集只包括轴突的灰度图像。特征图10-14和17进行了测试，但没有提高分类的效果。这也是为什么上述特征图（10-17）被排除分析。这并不是说，具有10-17并不重要;它们可以是用于其他数据集类型是有用的。</p>
<p>To evaluate different branch merging patterns in the disconnected initial trace we cluster branch terminal points on the basis of their relative distances.<br>为了改善不同分支合并的模式在分离初始追踪,我们在它们相对距离的基础上连接分支末端.<br>For this, we first create an all-to-all connected graph in which nodes represent the branch terminal points. Next, the links between distant nodes (&gt;10sx) are removed, exposing the clusters of nearby branch points.<br>为此,我们首先创造了代表分支节点末端的一个节点的全部连接图形,接下来,距离&gt;10sx的线会被移走,出现临近分支节点的集群.<br>The threshold distance of 10sx was chosen based on two considerations.<br>基于两方面考虑选择了10sx的阈值距离:<br>First, this distance has to be larger than the voxel size (sx) and the size of a typical gap in intensity resulting from imperfect labeling of branches (0 for OP and ~5sx for L6).<br>首先,这个距离必须比三维像素尺寸（SX） 和 在亮度上,由于不好的标记分支得到的一个典型间隙大小（0为OP和〜5SX为L6） 要大.<br>Second the threshold distance has to be smaller than the typical branch length (20sx-50sx for OP and L6).<br>第二,这个阀值距离必须小于典型分支长度(20sx-50sx对于OP和L6).<br>Results of branch merging are not sensitive to the precise value of this parameter in the 5sx–15sx range. Branch merging is examined within each cluster of branch terminal points independently.<br>在精确到5SX-15sx范围内参数,分支合并的结果是不明显的.在每一个独立的分支末端点集群中,分支合并是被检查.</p>
<p>Within a given cluster, all possible branch merging scenarios are considered (Figure 4A), and the correct merging pattern is determined in a classification framework.<br>在给定的群集中,我们会考虑采用所有可能的分支合并方案（图4A）,和在一个分类框架,去确定正确的合并模式.<br>Clusters containing 2 terminal points lead to two scenarios, i.e., to connect or not to connect the terminal points.<br>包含了两个末端点的多集群将导致两种情况:连接或不连接末端点.<br>Three terminal point clusters result in 5 scenarios, 4 terminal point clusters lead to 15 (Figure 4A), and the number of scenarios increases exponentially with the complexity of clusters (Figure 4B).<br>三个末端点的集群将导致五种结果，四个末端点的集群将导致十五种结果（图4A），和结果的数目与集群的复杂性（图4B）呈指数增大。<br>This exponential increase gives a unique advantage to our classification approach to branch merging.<br>对于进行分支合并的分类,该指数增长提供了一个独特的优势.</p>
<p>Generally, machine learning applications require large sets of labeled data.<br>一般情况下，机器学习应用需要大量标记数据。<br>Creating such sets can be very time-consuming and, in many cases, impractical.<br>创造这样的集合是非常费时,在许多情况下，不实用。<br>Our training strategy circumvents this problem by exploiting the large numbers of branch merging scenarios.<br>我们的训练策略是利用大量的分支合并方案去规避了这一问题。<br>Labeling the correct branch merging scenario in a single cluster can provide thousands of training examples.<br>在一个集群中提供数以千计的例子去标记一个正确的分支合并方案.<br>Hence, it becomes possible to train the classifier in real time and obtain accurate results by labeling only 10–100 clusters of branch terminal points.<br>因此,在现实中有可能训练出分类器,通过仅仅标记10-100个分类末端点的集群去获取精确的结果.<br>All possible branch merging scenarios are evaluated within a given cluster of branch terminal points.<br>在给定的分支末端节点集群中,所有可能的分支合并的方案都会被评估.<br>Each scenario, i, is characterized by a feature vector xi (Figure 4A) whose components consist of features of the trace that may be important for selecting the correct branch merging scenario (Figure 3).<br>每个方案其特点是一个特征矢量xi（图4A）,其组件包括可能是重要的追踪的特性,对于筛选正确的分支合并方案（图3）。<br>The problem is thus reduced to learning the best set of weights, w, for discriminating between the correct and erroneous scenarios within every cluster.<br>因此,对于如何辨别每个集群中正确还是错误的方案,这个问题被简化为如何得到最好权重W,</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/04skYCn.png" alt="Imgur"></p>
<p>This formulation leads to another important advantage for the implementation of the classification strategy. Due to the linearity of the problem, Equation (5) can be rewritten as,<br>这公式对于实现分类策略有其他重要优势。由于问题是线性的，方程式如下</p>

The geometrical precision of the automated and manual traces is evidenced by the fact that 95% of distance values lie below 2.3 voxels in Figure 6C, 7.3 voxels in Figure 6D,<br>和机器与用户的对比(红线).这个自动化追踪和手工追踪的几何精密是由事实来评估的:95%的距离值都小于2.3体积像素在图6C,7.3体积像素在图6D,<br>and 6.6 voxels in Figure 6E. More importantly, the difference between mean distances for the inter-user and automated-to-user comparisons (0.19, 0.51, and 0.65 voxels respectively) is smaller than the resolution of the image,<br>和6.6体积像素在图6E.更重要的是,用户间和机器与用户之间的比较的真实距离的不同时远小于图像的分辨率的.<br>and thus should have little bearing on trace dependent measurements. Similar conclusions were drawn from the geometrical comparisons of automated and manual traces of the L6 dataset (Figures 7A–C).<br>因此,应该有小误差在追踪中使用的尺寸.相似的结论由L6数据集中机器与手工追踪形态学比较中可以得出(图7A-C).</p>
